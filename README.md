# 20-20-20 Timer

A recent study showed that a large proportion of people believed their eyesight had been deteriorating during lockdown.

This appears to be due to prolonged periods of time in front of the screen, and presumably fewer distractions and reasons to get up and look away from your monitor compared to working in an office.

Fight for Sight, a research charity, [recommends](https://www.fightforsight.org.uk/news-and-articles/articles/news/screen-time/) screen users should look at something **20 feet away, for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes**.

Another fact about lockdown is you don't have a whole lot of options for things to do. So my time has been spent mostly with little software hacks & projects...

This tiny web app will remind you to follow the 20-20-20 rule. The timer beeps to alert you every 20 minutes, and counts down the 20 seconds you need to be looking away.

It's built with React & Typescript and the HTML `canvas` & `audio` elements.

You can run it locally with:

`yarn start`

Create a production build with:

`yarn build`
